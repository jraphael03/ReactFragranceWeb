npm init -                                             creates package.json (manifest) file, list dependencies
npm install <package name> --save    install package locally (default) and add to package.json
npm install <package name> -g           installs package globally (access anywhere) SUDO
npm install <package name> --save-dev   use it only in development

npx create-react-app (app-name)

In new react folder
Delete in src
App.css
App.test.js
Logo.svg
serviceWorker.js and/or reportWebVitals.js
setUpTests.js

Then remove the file imports from the index.js file in src so it will remove the errors


Another way of starting react delete all files in src besides index.js, then completely clean the index.js file 

Starting a new index.js
import React from 'react';    //imports es6 modules
import ReactDom from 'react-dom';


function Greeting(){          //function name must have a capital letter
  return <h4>This is Justin and this is my first component</h4>;
}


ReactDom.render(<Greeting />, document.getElementById('root'));         //render looks for two things, what you want to render, and where you want it to be rendered


Creating  a css file
Inside of src create a file, index.css
Connect to index.js
